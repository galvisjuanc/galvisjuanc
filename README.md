- 👋 Hi, I’m @galvisjuanc. My name is Juan Camilo Galvis Cuéllar. I'm from Bogotá, Colombia. I'm 29. I'm an Electronic Engineer, hopefully to be an awesome Developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in Martial Arts (Hapkido), Music (Guitar, Bass, Piano), hanging out with friends, renewable energies and traveling all around the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, SQL, ReactJS, JS, NodeJS, Springboot, Python and C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects someday. Meanwhile, I'll learn as much as I can to be the help you need.
